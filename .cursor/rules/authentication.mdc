# Authentication Guide

The application uses Supabase Authentication with Next.js App Router middleware for protected routes.

## Core Authentication Files
- [middleware.ts](mdc:middleware.ts) - Route protection and auth middleware
- [lib/supabase/client.ts](mdc:lib/supabase/client.ts) - Browser-side auth client
- [lib/supabase/server.ts](mdc:lib/supabase/server.ts) - Server-side auth utilities

## Protected Routes
All protected routes are under the (protected) route group:
- [app/(protected)/layout.tsx](mdc:app/(protected)/layout.tsx) - Auth check layout
- [app/(protected)/dashboard](mdc:app/(protected)/dashboard) - Dashboard routes

## Auth Components
Authentication-related components:
- [components/auth](mdc:components/auth) - Auth forms and UI
- [components/providers](mdc:components/providers) - Auth context providers

## Public Routes
Public routes accessible without authentication:
- [app/(public)/auth](mdc:app/(public)/auth) - Auth pages
- [app/(public)/(marketing)](mdc:app/(public)/(marketing)) - Marketing pages
