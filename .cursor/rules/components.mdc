# Components Guide

The project uses a component-based architecture with shadcn/ui components and custom components organized by feature.

## UI Components
All base UI components are built with Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS:

- [components/ui](mdc:components/ui) - Contains all shadcn/ui components
  - Form components (input, select, checkbox)
  - Dialog components (modal, alert, drawer)
  - Navigation components (menu, tabs, breadcrumb)
  - Data display components (table, card, avatar)

## Feature Components
Components are organized by feature and access level:

- [components/auth](mdc:components/auth) - Authentication components
- [components/dashboard](mdc:components/dashboard) - Dashboard interface components
- [components/landing](mdc:components/landing) - Landing page components
- [components/common](mdc:components/common) - Shared components
- [components/providers](mdc:components/providers) - Context providers and wrappers
- [components/public](mdc:components/public) - Public page components

## Component Configuration
UI components are configured through:
- [components.json](mdc:components.json) - Global component settings
- [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts) - Styling configuration
